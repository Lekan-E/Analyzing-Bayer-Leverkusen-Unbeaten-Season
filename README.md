# Analyzing-Bayer-Leverkusen-Unbeaten-Season
### An analysis of over 130,000 event data on Bayer Leverkusen's invincible season using Statsbomb API in Python and Tableau. Check full article here.

This project was done using data collected by Statsbomb. After going an entire 34-game season unbeaten, I decided to obtain insights into how Bayer Leverkusen were able to achieve this. This process involved studying their formation, passing network, how well they shot the ball against each team using a goal map and many more. 

In the Jupyter Notebook, I will demonstrate how to prepare the data to build the following visualizations in Tableau:
- Pass Map
- Pass Network
- Average Position
- xG Plot
- League Table (Bumpy Chart)
- Shotmap

### League Table
The final league standings, show team’s position during each game week. In the 2023/24 season, Leverkusen’s defensive solidity and attacking versatility were key to their success. They scored 87 goals, secured 28 wins, remained unbeaten in 17 away games, achieved 10 consecutive wins, and amassed 90 points to clinch the Meisterschale.

### Tactical Setup
Xabi Alonso’s Bayer Leverkusen frequently employed a 3-4-3 formation, one that allows for midfield control, and defensive solidity with flexibility. This setup provided better coverage of the central areas while the wing backs often dropped back to form five-man defense when out of possession. When attacking, the wingbacks were deployed higher up the pitch to provide width, stretch the opponent’s defence, create space for the forwards and deliver crosses into the box.

### xG Trendline
With this tactical setup, Xabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen excelled in creating high-quality scoring opportunities. The 34-game expected goals (xG) trendline illustrates a significant xG difference, outplaying their opponents in 28 out of the 34 games.

### Pass Network
The team’s formation remained consistent throughout the season. An analysis of their pass network highlights the cohesiveness and stability of their play.

### Player Involvement
Scoring goals was not a problem for Bayer Leverkusen, with 16 different players finding the back of the net. Leading the charge was newly acquired Nigerian forward Victor Boniface. Boniface wasted no time making his mark, contributing 18 goals (10 goals, 8 assists) in his first 16 league games.

### Pass Map
Xhaka's tireless work rate and exceptional passing accuracy were crucial to Leverkusen's success. Achieving a remarkable 93% accuracy from 3,275 passes, he became an indispensable part of the squad. His ability to dictate play, recycle possession, and maintain the team's structure both defensively and offensively highlighted his importance in Xabi Alonso's system.
